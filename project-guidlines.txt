AWD Projects
To manage this effectively for a 10% weightage (which usually falls under the "Sessional/Assignment" head), the projects must be scoped correctly—not too small (like a calculator) and not too massive (like a full ERP).
Here is a list of distinct MERN Stack Project topics (one for each group) to ensure variety and minimize copying, along with a grading rubric.
Mandatory Technical Requirements for All Groups
Every project must include:
1.	Authentication: Login/Signup (JWT based) and Password Hashing.

3.	CRUD: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for the main feature.
4.	Frontend: React Functional Components with Hooks (useState, useEffect).
5.	Routing: Protected routes (cannot access dashboard without login).

Grading Rubric (Total: 10 Marks)
Since this is a 3-credit theory course, the evaluation should focus on logic and code quality rather than just design.

Backend API (Node/Express)	3.0	Are APIs RESTful? Is the folder structure correct (Controllers/Routes)? Does it handle errors?
Database (MongoDB)	2.0	Proper Schema design. Are relationships (e.g., user_id in posts) handled correctly?
Frontend (React)	3.0	Component structure, State management, API integration (Axios/Fetch), and Responsiveness.
Authentication & Security	1.0	Is the password hashed? Can a non-logged-in user access private pages?

Total	10	
Deliverables Required from Students
1.	Source Code: GitHub Repository link.
2.	Project Report (Short): 5-10 pages containing Problem Statement, Database Schema Diagram, and Screen-shots.
3.	Live Demo: Running on their local laptop during the final Viva.
